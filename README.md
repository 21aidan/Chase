A quick web project emulating the UK gameshow The Chase.
This is intended to be used in conjunction with a seperate system for questions and answering, it is only for displaying the board.
To load simply run the html file on your local browser.

How to play:
- Press 1 when the blue player gets a question right
- Press 2 when the red player (chaser) gets a question right

Future additions:
- Make it look more like the actual gameshow, currently the design is just for proof of concept
- Add sounds when certain things happen (i.e when the contestant gets a question right and moves down a space, or a button to play the theme tune before each question)
- Add extra effects such as colours changing etc
- Add a game finish screen and potentially a reset button (although refreshing the page works fine)
- Add an undo button in case the wrong input is accidentally pressed
